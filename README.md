- 👋 Hi, I’m @Developer3244 (the real one. The other is also me but i lost the account info so i created another)
- 👀 I’m interested in rhythm games, 3D environments, $$$, and a few other projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning unity, and how to actually make my games
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games, if im not working in a project that can cause clashes with the ones i can collaborate
- 📫 How to reach me ...good luck to try
- 😄 Pronouns: male pronouns and some dedicated to pixelated rock islands
- ⚡ Fun fact: science studies say that even the most simple living 1 cell thing is really more complex than other non-living stuff.
- And humans are incredibly more complex than that. So you should use this complexity for something better than scrolling down your social media page!
